In this first screenshot :-

    In the first line We have <!DOCTYPE html>, which declares the document type.

    <html> tag, which defines the whole html document.

    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)

    <title>Cat Photo App</title> element sets the title of the HTML document, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.

In these screenshot :-

    <body> element contains the visible content of the HTML document, including headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, etc.

    "h1" is a heading tag which is used to give headings to the content, here "h1" is used for the heading named 'The Gallery Cafe'(there are 6 of them, h1 is used for the most important headings, and it keeps reducing to <h6>). Here <h1>Cat Photo App</h1> heading is used.

    <h2>Cat Photo</h2> is used for a subheading that provides additional information about the content.

    A paragraph(<p> tag) element is used which contains a link (anchor <a> tag) that directs to the section with the ID "lasagna" on the same page.

    <a href="#"><img src="./relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="relaxing cat"></a> is an anchor element that wraps an image, there are two attributes used inside the <img> tag, first is "src" which contains the path of the image or source and the another is alternative "alt" which contains the information which is displayed if the image doesn't work. When someone clicks on the image, it leads to the URL specified in the "href" attribute (here I have specified "#", which means it won't navigate anywhere, it redirects to the same page only).

    <div> division element with the ID "lasagna", it is used to group and style content. It contains a heading, an unordered list, an image, and a paragraph related to cat lists and lasagna.

    Inside the <div> tag, a <h2> heading is used, and one <h3> heading is also used for subheading. After that comes a unorded list created using <ul> tag that contains list items (using <li> tag) representing things that cats love. Then an image tag <img> is also used to attach an image.

    After that, another subheading using <h3> tag.

    Then comes  an ordered list element(using <ol> tag) that contains list items (using <li> tag) representing things that cats hate.

    Then I have added another image of cats using the <img> tag.

    After that one sentence is using <p> tag and <strong> tag is also used to make the text inside it important.

In this screenshot :-

    It starts with a heading using <h2> tag.

    Then <table> tag is used to define a table structure. The "border" attribute specifies whether to display table borders. 
    
    Inside the <table> tag there are some other tags which are used :
        <thead> - adds a separate header to the table
        <th> - used to add table headings
        <tbody> - shows the main body of the table
        <tr> - represents rows
        <td> - used to create data cells
        there are two more attributes used inside <td> tag, 
              Colspan: Specifies the number of columns a cell should span.
              Rowspan: Specifies the number of rows a cell should span.

In this last screenshot :-

    A heading is created using <h2> tag.

    Then <p>...</p>: A paragraph element that contains various inline elements for text formatting, including strong, b, i, and em tags.

    <strong>...</strong>: Represents strongly emphasized text.
    
    <b>...</b>: Represents text that should be in bold.
    
    <i>...</i>: Represents text that is in italics.
    
    <em>...</em>: Represents emphasized text.

    Then there is body closing tag and the html closing tag.
